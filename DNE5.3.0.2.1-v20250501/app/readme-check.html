<h2><b>CHECK : How to use samples</b></h2>
<b>1. Please check the product model of your robot.</b><br>
Communication is done by sending and receiving MQTT messages using JavaScript.<br>
MQTT messages and some system features are only available for E-series or other system integration products.<br>
In some simpler product line-ups, users can NOT use these applications, and the MQTT interface is NOT supported.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Please enable Cookie on your browser.</b><br>
If enable Cookie, for example "address" is displayed fine on top page.</b><br>
<br>
<b>3. Check the string at the top of the each sample application.</b><br>
This indicates the connection status.<br>
If MQTT on Websocket is connected successfully, the unit serial number will be displayed.</b><br>
<br>
<b>4. For other trouble shooting.</b><br>
Please check with the distributor or the contact listed in the instruction manual.<br>
